# Localtrade

This project was a result of an idea to have greener transportation in a city where there is too much use of polluting vehicles, even in the city center.

The aim is to make a platform where consumers businesses and couriers that own a green vehicle, can all be in contact. 
In that way, if I buy a package that is 10km away from my home, I can choose to have a more approachable method of delivery, tracking how much it will polute the environment or the city I live in.

The idea is to launch it only in the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
