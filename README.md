# Localtrade

This project was a result of several ideas, one of them being: to have greener transportation in a city where there is too much use of polluting vehicles for short distances.

The aim is to make a platform where consumers, smaller businesses and couriers that own a green vehicle, can all be in contact.
In that manner, if I buy a package that I cannot pick up, 10km away from my home, I can choose to have a more approachable method of delivery, by going in to the app, getting in contact with a local courier, track the delivery, and receive it at home, always keeping the whole lifecycle as green and ecofriendly as possible.

The idea would be to launch it only in the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
